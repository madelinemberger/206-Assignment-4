```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#load necessary packages

Read in the CSVs

```{r}


lobster_size <- read_csv("lobster_size_abundance.csv")
lobster_traps <- read_csv("lobster_traps.csv")
```

The lobster_size file needs to be converted to tidyverse format

```{r}
lobster_size1 <- as.data.frame(lobster_size)
lobster_size2 <- expand.dft(lobster_size1, freq = "COUNT")

lobster_traps1 <- as.data.frame(lobster_traps)
lobster_traps2 <- expand.dft(lobster_traps, freq = "TRAPS")

lobster_traps_clean <- lobster_traps %>% 
  select(YEAR, MONTH, SITE, TRAPS) %>% 
  count(SITE, YEAR) %>% 
  spread(YEAR, n) 

trap_plot <- lobster_traps %>% 
  select(YEAR, MONTH, SITE, TRAPS) %>% 
  filter(SITE== "CARP", SITE== "MOHK", SITE== "AQUE", SITE== "NAPL", SITE== "IVEE") %>% 
  count(SITE, YEAR) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = YEAR, y = n)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=SITE)) +
  theme_classic()

quartz()
trap_plot
  
```

Data wrangling:


1.Lobster abundance and fishing pressure (2012 - 2017) Describe trends in lobster abundance (counts) and fishing pressure (trap buoys) at the five locations from 2012 - 2017.
