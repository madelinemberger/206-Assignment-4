```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#load necessary packages 

library(tidyverse)
library(vcdExtra)
library(kableExtra)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(car)
library(effsize)
```

Read in the CSVs

```{r}


lobster_size <- read_csv("lobster_size_abundance.csv")
lobster_traps <- read_csv("lobster_traps.csv")
```

The lobster_size file needs to be converted to tidyverse format

```{r}
lobster_size1 <- as.data.frame(lobster_size)
lobster_size2 <- expand.dft(lobster_size1, freq = "COUNT")

lobster_traps1 <- as.data.frame(lobster_traps)
lobster_traps2 <- expand.dft(lobster_traps, freq = "TRAPS")

lobster_traps_clean <- lobster_traps %>% 
  select(-NOTES)
```

Data wrangling:


1.Lobster abundance and fishing pressure (2012 - 2017) Describe trends in lobster abundance (counts) and fishing pressure (trap buoys) at the five locations from 2012 - 2017.
